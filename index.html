		<h2>Who I Am</h2>
		<p>Hi there! My name's Cory Williams and I'm from the awesome little town of San Luis Obispo, CA. </p>
		<p>I love being outside when I'm not on a computer. I love hiking, biking, tennis, snowboarding in winter, and just hanging out with friends and exploring new interesting places.</p>

		<h2>My History</h2>
		<p>I got my hands on my first computer when I was 10. In Junior High my friends showed me the true power of what computers were capable of when they programmed their own software and hacked the school's computers to bend to their will. I became fascinated with this world and wanted to learn how I could use computers to make the world a better place. </p>

		<h2>My Work</h2>
		<p>I've been a front-end web developer for about 8 years, and have never really explored the server side end of the spectrum. I am excited to be joining the Galvanize program to get me up to speed with the latest and greatest technologies.</p>
		<p>I took a small break from web development 2 years ago and became a wedding photographer. I started my own business and am currently support myself as a wedding cinematographer. You can see my wedding work here - <a href="http://www.surrealweddingfilms.com">www.surrealweddingfilms.com</a></p>
